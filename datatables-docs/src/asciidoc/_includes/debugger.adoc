== 12. Debugging tools

Dandelion-Core provides some debugging tools that can be extended by components. In particular, Dandelion-Datatables extends the existing live debugger by adding a new menu in the sidebar, composed of new debug pages.

=== 12.1. Current options

This debug page allows you list all <<11-configuration-options, options>> currently activated in all tables present in the current page.

In particularly, you can see for each table:

* the activated option group
* the current extensions
* the list of all activated options

In this page, you can view all <<11-4-using-option-groups, options groups>> computed by Dandelion-Datatables. All these group are computed from the <<11-configuration-options, configuration file>>.
