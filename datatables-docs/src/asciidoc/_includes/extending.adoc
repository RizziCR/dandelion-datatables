== 13. Extending Dandelion-Datatables

=== 13.1. Introducing the extension mechanism

Since the earliest version of Dandelion-Datatables, we've been trying to develop the component in a modular manner. That's why if you dig into the source code, you'll see lots of already existing extensions as the `AjaxFeature`, the `ServerSideFeature`, or the `Bootstrap2Theme`, ...


Starting from the v0.9.0, you can now write your own extensions, thus providing a powerful mechanism to customize your tables.

==== 13.1.1. What is an extension?

Any extension will generally fall into one of three categories:

* *Theme*: extension used to theme a table (e.g. `Bootstrap2Theme`)
* *Plugin*: extension used to encapsulate a DataTables' native plugin (e.g. `ScrollerPlugin`)
* *Feature*: all other extensions (e.g. `ServerSideFeature`)

But generally speaking, we'll call it simply _extension_.

[discrete]
==== 13.1.2. What can I do with an extension?

[discrete]
===== 13.1.2.1. Access the DataTables' parameters

One of the key features of Dandelion-Datatables is that it generates all the needed DataTables parameters for you, depending on how you used the JSP taglib or the Thymeleaf dialect.

By using the extension mechanism, you can easily modify these parameters:

* by adding or replacing any of them
* by adding a DataTable <<7-3-using-callbacks, callback>>
* by chaining another Javascript call

[discrete]
===== 13.1.2.2. Access the Dandelion bundles

Often the extension needs some extra Javascript code, e.g. a library.

The concept of _asset bundle_ introduced in the v0.10.0 is also accessible from any extension. Thus, you can benefit from the powerful asset system of Dandelion and play with bundles inside your extension.

[discrete]
===== 13.1.2.3. Access the whole generated Javascript file

Any Javascript code can be inserted in the generated Javascript file. Useful if you need for example to set a variable before the DataTables initialization.

[discrete]
===== 13.1.2.4. Access the HTML table

The HTML table can be easily accessed, as well as the columns and all other nested tags.

To summarize, you have here a powerful mechanism in situations where all ready-to-use extensions don't fit your needs.

To go further, see how to write your own extension in the next section.

=== 13.2. Writing your own extension

Writing you own extension is quite easy. Just follow these steps:

* Step 1: create a class that extends `com.github.dandelion.datatables.core.extension.AbstractExtension`:

+
[source, java]
----
package com.example;

import com.github.dandelion.datatables.core.extension.AbstractExtension;
import com.github.dandelion.datatables.core.html.HtmlTable;

public class MyCustomExtension extends AbstractExtension {

  public String getName() {
    return "myAwesomeExtension"; // <1>
  }

  public void setup(HtmlTable table) { // <2>
    // load some bundles...
    // modify the TableConfiguration...
    // add, remove, update any DataTable parameter...
  }
}
----
<1> The name is important here. It will be used later to activate the extension.
<2> The `HtmlTable` instance is made available here, thus providing access to both the table structure (HTML) and its configuration through the `TableConfiguration` instance.

* Step 2 : in the `META-INF/services` folder of your project, create a text file (UTF-8 encoded) using the following convention:

.Example with a Maven project
[source, xml]
----
project-root
|__ src
   |__ main
      |__ resources
         |__ META-INF
            |__ services
               |__ com.github.dandelion.datatables.core.extension.Extension
----

Inside this file, just add the fully qualified name of your extension. 

 com.example.MyCustomExtension

Dandelion-Datatables will then load your custom extension thanks to the http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/ext/basics/spi.html#the-serviceloader-class[Service Loader mechanism], as any other ones provided by the component.
 
=== 13.3. Activating your own extension

Once the extension and the `com.github.dandelion.datatables.core.extension.Extension` file created, the extension will be detected by the component, but it still needs to be _activated_ in one or more tables.

As for the majority of <<_11_configuration_options,configuration options>>, there are several ways to activate your extension.

[discrete]
=== 13.3.1. Globally

Globally implicitly means using <<_11_3_using_global_options, global options>>, i.e. you can activate the extension in all tables of your web application.

That is what the <<opt-main.extension.names, `main.extension.names`>> option is for.

[source, properties]
----
global.main.extension.names=myAwesomeExtension <1>
----
<1> Note that the <<opt-main.extension.names, `main.extension.names`>> option is prefixed by the `global` group, thus activating the extension globally. Also note that `myAwesomeExtension` if the name of the extension previously set in the `getName()` method of the extension.
 
NOTE: You can of course reduce the scope of application by using a <<_11_4_using_option_groups, custom option group>> instead of the global one.

[discrete]
=== 13.3.2. Locally

Locally implicitly means either using the <<_appendix_a_jsp_taglib_reference, JSP taglib>> or the <<_appendix_b_thymeleaf_dialect_reference, Thymeleaf dialect>>, i.e. in a single table.

[discrete]
==== Using JSP

Use the <<jsp-table-ext, `ext`>> table attribute and set one or more extension names separated by a comma.

[source, xml]
----
<datatables:table ... ext="myAwesomeExtension"> <1>
  ...
</datatables:table>
----
<1> `myAwesomeExtension` if the name of the extension previously set in the `getName()` method of the extension

[discrete]
==== Using Thymeleaf

Use the <<tml-table-ext, `dt:ext`>> in the same way as for JSP.

[source, xml]
----
<table ... dt:ext="myAwesomeExtension"> <1>
  ...
</table>
----
<1> `myAwesomeExtension` if the name of the extension previously set in the `getName()` method of the extension

And that's all! Your extension(s) will be loaded as any other built-in extension before the table is displayed.

=== 13.4. Extending an already existing extension
